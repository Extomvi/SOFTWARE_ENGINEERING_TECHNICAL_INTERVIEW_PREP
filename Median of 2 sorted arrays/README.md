# Median of 2 sorted Arrays

## DESCRIPTION

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.


### EXAMPLE 1

```BASH
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
### EXAMPLE 2

```BASH
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
